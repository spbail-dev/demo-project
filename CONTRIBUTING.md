# Contributing to this project

In order to contribute to this demo project, go through the steps described in my talk! In short:

## 1. Copy the repo
- Fork the repo on GitHub
- Clone your fork to your local machine: `git clone <repo url>`

## 2. Environment setup
- Install the required Python packages: 
  - Optional: Create a new conda or virtual environment
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure all tests run: `pytest`
  
## 3. Development loop
- Check out a new branch and make your code changes on a branch
- Re-run the tests to see if anything broke, fix if necessary
- Add new tests if you're adding new functionality!
- Commit the changes, push to a branch, open a pull request, wait for feedback!
